# alikala

this a full stack online shopping application like Digikala.com.

### Roadmap (& Note to self)

- Play around, learn, test, develope & find contribution ideas with following libraries
[crystalline](https://pub.dev/packages/crystalline)
[dart_frog](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog)
[jaspr](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr)
maybe I use serverpod for this, because I'm already using dart_frog & jaspr for my own website. 
I don't wanna double learn these stuff. but I should also think creating which tutorial would be better.
[serverpod](https://serverpod.dev)

- To be used as a material for a youtube tutorial for a full stack dart app 
- To try and modify it later into a white label shop app
- And later on a white label shop app tutorial
